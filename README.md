# Rocketry-Alogorithims
Collection of Matlab scripts used to design and constrain various aspects of chemical rocket propulsion and design.

These scripts were taken and used during a graduate level chemical rocket propulsion class at Colorado State University to determine constraints of a bell nozzle, as well as a solid fuel rocket of htpb and GOx.
